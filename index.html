          <div>
            <div><br /></div>
            <div>The setting for the Parakaleo ministry is the Stanford University community, where staff members have counseled and trained Biblical counselors since 1975.</div>
            <div><br /></div>
            <div>The Stanford campus can be an atmosphere of intense pressure not only for undergraduate and graduate students, but also for faculty and staff. Personal needs encountered by Parakaleo counselors include uncertainties about sexuality, marriage, family strife, academic adequacy, careers, self-worth, depression and suicide.</div>
            <div><br /></div>
            <div>The needs are too great for one or two counselors to meet. Thus Parakaleo staff members place high priority on discipling counselors among students in addition to counseling students themselves. Central to the training program is the Biblical counseling course at Stanford.</div>
            <div><br /></div>
            <div>Because Stanford University attracts students with leadership abilities, Parakaleo counselors are in an unusually strategic position to help develop Christian leaders.</div>
            <div><br /></div>
            <div>Over a thousand students have been trained and counseled by Parakaleo during its first three decades of ministry. At least 75 of these have entered vocational Christian ministries, while numerous others have applied their training as church elders.</div>
            <div><br /></div>
            <div>Several hundred have gone on short-term missions in Eastern and Western Europe, India, Asia, Africa and Latin America. Others have obtained counseling positions in secular environments or entered professions with significant opportunities for counseling, such as medicine and law.</div>
            <div><br /></div>
            <div>These leaders minister as they have been equipped and also disciple more counselors. Once they move on, Parakaleo remains available to serve these counselor by correspondence, publications, cassette tapes, and other training materials, as requested.</div>

          <h5>Biblical Counseling Course (Spring 2020)</h5>
          <p>
            We are eager to dig into the riches of 2 Corinthians 1-7 this fall, as
            we see together:
          </p>
          How the Lord uses the challenges of life, both circumstantial and
          relational
          <ul>
            <li>to greatly deepen our walks with Him</li>
            <li>to grow in His character in practice</li>
            <li>and to be equipped to help a lifetime of others.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We will be learning from the Lord through this description from Paul of the
            fundamental principles of his ministry including how to seek reconciliation in
            relations strained by misunderstanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Join us and spread the word by inviting others who may benefit as well as we
            learn together through a combination of presentation and interactive
            participation, also developing helpful methods and techniques for feeding
            oneself effectively and fruitfully on God's word.
          </p>

          <!-- <h3 class="section-heading text-center">God's Wisdom for Life-filled, Life-giving Relationships</h3>
          Vital insights into greatly deepening your own personal relationship with Jesus
          and
          how to partner with Him to grow meaningful, mutually up-building relationships
          with real people like me
          whether friends, roommates, family, dating, engagement, marriage
          or vision to prepare for a future truly fulfilling Christ-centered marriage.
          Paul's letter to the Ephesians is God's practical instruction to us in the "how-to's" of interpersonal relationships. It begins with insights into the amazing real and lasting provisions that God has already given me and every believer in Jesus, that give me:
          hope to grow to live and love ever more like Jesus during this current life on earth (and not just when I die and go to heaven)
          great worth to God because of my potential as a new creature in Christ with the Holy Spirit reproducing His life in me (much more than just forgiveness!)
          immense power to rise up out of my natural approach to life with all its defects, limitations and frustrations into relating to others in ways that really bless them and fulfill me as I grow into closer alliance with Jesus and His and our heavenly Father.
          for both your own encouragement
          and
          equipping to help a lifetime of others.
